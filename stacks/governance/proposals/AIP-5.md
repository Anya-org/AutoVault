# AIP-5: Vault Precision and Withdrawal Security

## Simple Summary

Enhance vault precision calculations and withdrawal security to prevent
rounding errors and ensure accurate share-based accounting.

## Abstract

This proposal improves vault withdrawal precision and implements additional
security measures for share-based deposits and withdrawals, addressing
potential precision loss in large-scale operations.

## Motivation

Security audit identified potential vault withdrawal precision issues that
could lead to rounding errors in share calculations. Enhanced precision
ensures accurate accounting and prevents value loss for users.

## Specification

- Implement high-precision arithmetic for share calculations
- Add minimum withdrawal amounts to prevent dust attacks
- Enhance vault pause validation for emergency situations
- Implement withdrawal queue system for large redemptions
- Add precision safeguards for fee calculations

## Rationale

Precise share-based accounting is critical for vault integrity and user trust.
Enhanced precision prevents rounding errors while maintaining gas efficiency.

## Implementation Status ✅ **COMPLETE**

- ✅ Vault functionality verified (production test suite passing)
- ✅ Share-based accounting tested and working
- ✅ Fee structures verified and operational
- ✅ Vault admin controls verified
- ✅ **COMPLETED:** Precision enhancement implementation
- ✅ **COMPLETED:** Withdrawal queue system development
- ✅ **Implementation File:** `/vault-precision-implementation.clar`
- ✅ **High-precision arithmetic for large deposits active**
- ✅ **Withdrawal queue liquidity management operational**
- ✅ **Enhanced fee calculation accuracy implemented**
- ✅ **Overflow protection mechanisms deployed**

## Test Results ✅ **ALL PASSING**

```text
