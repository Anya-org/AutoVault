3. **Voting Period** → Token-weighted democratic voting (1 week)
4. **Execution Delay** → Timelock safety period (1 day)
5. **Automatic Execution** → Smart contract implementation
6. **Analytics Tracking** → Performance monitoring and adjustment

### Bounty System Flow

1. **Bounty Creation** → Community identifies development needs
2. **DAO Funding** → Governance votes to allocate treasury funds
3. **Developer Application** → Contributors apply with proposals
4. **Assignment** → Bounty creators select developers
5. **Milestone Execution** → Progress-based development with reviews
6. **Automatic Rewards** → Smart contract payment + creator tokens
7. **Reputation Building** → Long-term contributor recognition
