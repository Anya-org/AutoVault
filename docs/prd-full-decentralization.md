- Treasury fund allocation and spending
- Protocol upgrades and contract changes
- Bounty creation and reward distribution
- Token minting and distribution policies

### 2. On-Chain Bounty System
**Objective**: Incentivize community development and contributions

#### 2.1 Bounty Management
- **Creation**: Token holders can propose and fund bounties
- **Categories**: Development, security, documentation, analytics
- **Milestone Tracking**: Progress-based payment releases
- **Automatic Distribution**: Smart contract-based reward payments

#### 2.2 Creator Token Rewards
- **Contribution Tracking**: On-chain record of all contributions
- **Token Minting**: Automatic governance token rewards for contributors
- **Reputation System**: Long-term contributor recognition and benefits
- **Vesting Schedules**: Time-locked rewards for sustained participation

### 3. Advanced Analytics & Events
**Objective**: Comprehensive protocol monitoring and optimization

#### 3.1 Event System
- **Structured Events**: Standardized event schemas for all operations
- **Historical Tracking**: Complete audit trail of all protocol actions
- **Real-time Metrics**: Live protocol health and performance indicators
- **User Analytics**: Individual and aggregate usage patterns

#### 3.2 Optimization Engine
- **Dynamic Fee Adjustment**: Automated fee optimization based on utilization
- **Risk Management**: Automated parameter adjustments for protocol safety
- **Yield Optimization**: Intelligent capital allocation strategies
- **Predictive Analytics**: Usage forecasting and capacity planning

### 4. Multi-Token Support
**Objective**: Support diverse asset types and yield strategies

#### 4.1 Token Integration
- **SIP-010 Compliance**: Full support for all SIP-010 tokens
- **Multi-Asset Vaults**: Separate vaults for different token types
- **Cross-Vault Operations**: Token swapping and rebalancing
- **Yield Farming**: Integration with external DeFi protocols

#### 4.2 Risk Management
- **Asset-Specific Parameters**: Individual risk controls per token type
- **Correlation Analysis**: Portfolio risk assessment across assets
- **Liquidation Mechanisms**: Automated risk mitigation strategies
- **Insurance Integration**: Protocol insurance for covered assets

```

### Governance Flow
1. **Proposal Creation**: Token holders submit proposals with required stake
2. **Discussion Period**: Community review and feedback (off-chain/on-chain)
3. **Voting Period**: Token-weighted voting with delegation support
4. **Execution Delay**: Timelock period for critical changes
5. **Implementation**: Automatic execution or manual trigger
6. **Monitoring**: Post-implementation tracking and adjustment

### Bounty System Flow
1. **Bounty Creation**: Community proposes development needs
2. **Funding**: Token holders vote to allocate treasury funds
3. **Assignment**: Developers claim bounties and submit milestones
4. **Review**: Community validates milestone completion
5. **Payment**: Automatic reward distribution upon approval
6. **Token Rewards**: Creator tokens minted for contributors

## Success Metrics

### Decentralization Metrics
- **Governance Participation**: >50% token holder voting participation
- **Parameter Changes**: 100% community-driven decisions
- **Admin Dependency**: 0% reliance on centralized admin functions
- **Treasury Control**: Full DAO management of protocol funds

### Development Metrics
- **Active Bounties**: 10+ open bounties at any time
- **Contributor Growth**: 20% monthly increase in active contributors
- **Code Contributions**: 80% of development via bounty system
- **Innovation Rate**: 5+ new features per quarter via community

### Protocol Metrics
- **TVL Growth**: 25% quarterly increase in total value locked
- **User Adoption**: 50% quarterly increase in active users
- **Fee Optimization**: Automated fee adjustments maintain optimal utilization
- **Risk Management**: Zero protocol-level security incidents

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Governance (4 weeks)
