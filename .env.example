# Security Guidelines:
# 1. Generate private keys using hardware wallets or secure key generation tools
# 2. Store mnemonics offline in secure, encrypted storage
# 3. Use environment variables or secure vaults for production deployments
# 4. Never share private keys in chat, issues, or public documentation
# 5. Rotate keys regularly and after any suspected compromise
# 6. The .env file should NEVER be committed to version control
