# Documentation Alignment & Cleaning Changelog (Aug 22, 2025)

## Summary
All major documentation in `/documentation` has been aligned with actual code, test results, and canonical status sources. Outdated, contradictory, and redundant information was removed. Every doc now references canonical status and cross-links to the latest system/test reality.

## Changes
- `README.md`: Removed outdated contract/test counts, added canonical status references.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`: Updated contract/features list, linked to PRD and status docs.
- `SECURITY.md`: Aligned with actual AIP implementations, test coverage, and audit status.
- `TOKENOMICS.md`: Updated supply numbers, contract logic, and referenced canonical status.
- `ROADMAP.md`: Added canonical status reference and cross-link, validated phases.
- `DEPLOYMENT.md`: Updated deployment status, cost, upgrade strategy, and referenced canonical status.

## Validation
- All docs now reference `STATUS.md` and `TESTNET_DEPLOYMENT_VERIFICATION.md` for live contract/test/security status.
- No outdated or contradictory info remains.
- Documentation is now maintainable, Bitcoin-native, and production-ready.
