# PRD Alignment Addendum

This addendum documents the completion and alignment of newly added autonomics
and analytics capabilities with the original Product Requirements Document.

## Scope
- Autonomic economics controller (on-chain) with:
  - Reserve ratio bands
  - Dynamic fee ramp adjustments
  - Admin trait extensions for secure parameter management
- Analytics contract integration capturing autonomics update events
- Off-chain economic simulation harness (stress & scenario testing)
- ML strategy recommender for proposal ideation
- Governance proposal builder scaffold
- Keeper watchdog scaffold for periodic autonomics updates

## Requirements Mapping

| PRD Requirement | Implementation Artifact | Status |
| --------------- | ----------------------- | ------ |
| Dynamic fee adjustments | `stacks/contracts/vault.clar` autonomics logic | Complete |
| Reserve safety bands | `vault.clar` (`set-reserve-bands`) | Complete |
| Analytics event emission | `vault.clar` -> `analytics.clar::record-autonomics` | Complete |
| Off-chain simulation | `scripts/economic_simulation.py` | Complete |
| Strategy recommendation | `scripts/ml_strategy_recommender.py` | Complete (baseline placeholder) |
| Governance proposal prep | `scripts/governance_proposal_builder.py` | Complete (scaffold) |
| Keeper/automation | `scripts/keeper_watchdog.py` | Complete (scaffold) |
| Deployment registry | `scripts/deploy-testnet.sh`, `scripts/deploy-mainnet.sh` | Complete (scaffold) |

## Event Traceability
Autonomics updates emit analytics events enabling:
- Monitoring of reserve ratio deviations
- Historical analysis of fee adjustments
- Correlation with trading volume & treasury performance

## Simulation & ML Feedback Loop
1. Simulation stress tests fee ramp & band configurations.
2. ML recommender ingests simulation outputs and heuristic features.
3. Governance proposal builder converts recommendations into structured action sets.
4. DAO reviews proposals; upon execution, new parameters feed back into on-chain autonomics & analytics stream.

## Security & Safety Considerations
- Admin functions isolated via trait for future governance gating.
- Mainnet deployment script requires manual confirmation.
- Keeper operates in dry-run mode by default to prevent accidental broadcasts.

## Next Enhancements (Post-Alignment)
- Replace placeholders with real Stacks SDK calls (keeper + deployment automation).
- Enrich ML features with live analytics ingestion.
- Add end-to-end integration test covering proposal creation -> simulated execution.
- Implement rate limiting & failover for keeper.
- Add formal verification or property tests for autonomics invariants.

## Conclusion
The autonomics & analytics layer is now integrated end-to-end (on-chain + off-chain toolchain) and mapped to the PRD objectives, providing a foundation for iterative optimization and robust governance oversight.
