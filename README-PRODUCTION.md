### **Enhanced Tokenomics (PRODUCTION)**

| Token | Supply | Purpose | Implementation |
|-------|--------|---------|----------------|
| **AVG** | 10,000,000 | Governance & Revenue Sharing | `avg-token.clar` ✅ |
| **AVLP** | 5,000,000 | Liquidity Mining → Migrates to AVG | `avlp-token.clar` ✅ |

**Migration Schedule**:
- **Epoch 1** (Blocks 1-1008): 1.0 AVG per AVLP
- **Epoch 2** (Blocks 1009-2016): 1.2 AVG per AVLP (20% bonus)  
- **Epoch 3** (Blocks 2017-3024): 1.5 AVG per AVLP (50% bonus)

### **Treasury & Auto-Buyback System**

```typescript
Treasury Features (treasury.clar):
├── Category-Based Budgeting (6 categories)
├── STX Reserve Management (buyback fund)
├── Auto-Buyback Execution (weekly: 1,008 blocks)
├── DAO Spending Controls (governance required)
├── Emergency Reserve Functions
└── Budget Period Tracking

Auto-Buyback Configuration:
├── Frequency: Every 1,008 blocks (~weekly)
├── Threshold: 5% STX reserves minimum
├── Maximum: 10% treasury per buyback
└── Deflationary: Bought AVG tokens burned
```
