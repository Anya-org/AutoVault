# Security Incident Response Log

## Date: 2025-08-18

## Incident Type: Exposed Cryptographic Material

### Summary

Critical security vulnerability identified: testnet private keys and mnemonic seed phrases were exposed in repository files.

### Actions Taken

1. **Immediate Remediation**:
   - Removed exposed private key from TESTNET_WALLET_INFO.md
   - Removed exposed mnemonic from configuration files
   - Replaced sensitive values with secure placeholder templates
   - Updated .env.example with security guidelines

2. **Files Affected**:
   - `/workspaces/AutoVault/TESTNET_WALLET_INFO.md` - SECURED
   - `/workspaces/AutoVault/stacks/settings/Testnet.toml` - SECURED
   - `/workspaces/AutoVault/.env.example` - ENHANCED

3. **Compromised Keys** (DEPRECATED - DO NOT USE):
   - Private Key: `ddf291b96c4b6c193440e3652470738bc064b587681edc76112c2695ac33644f01`
   - Mnemonic: `light glare bench random limit flame change call boil wolf exercise bar test argue parade envelope execute chimney good seven warrior blue gorilla jaguar`
   - Testnet Address: `ST14G8ACZNKBPR0WTX55NZ38NHN6K75AJ1ED4YDPC`

### Required Actions Before Deployment

1. **Generate New Keys**: Use secure key generation tools
2. **Fund New Wallet**: Transfer testnet STX to new secure address
3. **Update Deployment Scripts**: Use new secure keys via environment variables
4. **Verify Security**: Ensure no sensitive data remains in repository

### Bitcoin Ethos Compliance

- User fund safety prioritized through immediate key rotation
- Non-custodial principles maintained with proper key management
