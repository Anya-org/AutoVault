```

### 🔧 Next Steps for Live Deployment

1. **Fund Deployer Account**
   - Obtain testnet STX from faucet or testnet community
   - Account: `STC5KHM41H6WHAST7MWWDD807YSPRQKJ68T330BQ`
   - Required: ~3 STX for deployment costs

2. **Execute Deployment**

   ```bash
   cd /workspaces/AutoVault/stacks
   npx clarinet deployment apply --testnet
   ```

3. **Post-Deployment Verification**

   ```bash
   npm run verify-post
   npm run monitor-health
   ```
