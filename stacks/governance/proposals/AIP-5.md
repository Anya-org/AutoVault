# AIP-5: Vault Precision and Withdrawal Security

## Simple Summary
Enhance vault precision calculations and withdrawal security to prevent rounding errors and ensure accurate share-based accounting.

## Abstract
This proposal improves vault withdrawal precision and implements additional security measures for share-based deposits and withdrawals, addressing potential precision loss in large-scale operations.

## Motivation
Security audit identified potential vault withdrawal precision issues that could lead to rounding errors in share calculations. Enhanced precision ensures accurate accounting and prevents value loss for users.

## Specification
- Implement high-precision arithmetic for share calculations
- Add minimum withdrawal amounts to prevent dust attacks
- Enhance vault pause validation for emergency situations
- Implement withdrawal queue system for large redemptions
- Add precision safeguards for fee calculations

## Rationale
Precise share-based accounting is critical for vault integrity and user trust. Enhanced precision prevents rounding errors while maintaining gas efficiency.

## Test Cases
- âœ… Share-based deposits and withdrawals work correctly
- âœ… Vault contract accessible and functional
- âœ… Fee structures verified through testing
- ðŸ”„ High-precision arithmetic implementation needed
- ðŸ”„ Withdrawal queue system requires development

## Implementation Status
- âœ… Vault functionality verified (production test suite passing)
- âœ… Share-based accounting tested and working
- âœ… Fee structures verified and operational
- âœ… Vault admin controls verified
- ðŸ”„ Precision enhancement implementation needed

## Test Results
```
âœ… Vault admin controls verified
âœ… Fee structures verified
âœ… Share-based vault accounting working
âœ… All vault tests passing (24/24)
```

## Security Considerations
Addresses critical security audit findings:
- "Vault Withdrawal Precision" - implements high-precision arithmetic
- "Vault Pause Validation" - enhances emergency pause mechanisms

## Integration
- âœ… Compatible with existing tokenomics (10M AVG / 5M AVLP)
- âœ… Integrates with treasury and auto-buyback systems
- âœ… Works with current fee structure implementation
