# AIP-3: Treasury Multi-Sig Security Enhancement

## Simple Summary
Enhance treasury security by implementing multi-signature requirements for all significant fund movements.

## Abstract
This proposal adds multi-signature validation to treasury spending functions, requiring multiple authorized signers to approve any fund movements above defined thresholds.

## Motivation
Current treasury implementation may allow unauthorized spending if DAO governance controls are compromised. Multi-sig provides additional security layer.

## Specification
- Implement 3-of-5 multi-sig for treasury spending > 10,000 tokens
- Add emergency pause functionality for treasury operations
- Require time delays for large withdrawals (>50,000 tokens)
- Add spending category limits and approval workflows

## Rationale
Multi-signature requirements reduce single point of failure and provide additional security for protocol funds while maintaining operational efficiency.

## Test Cases
- Multi-sig requirements enforced for large amounts
- Emergency pause prevents unauthorized access
- Time delays work correctly for large withdrawals
