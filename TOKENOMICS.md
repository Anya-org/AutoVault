- **Revenue Sharing**: 80% to AVG holders, 20% to protocol treasury

### 2. **Production-Ready Implementation**

- **Smart Contract Deployed**: All tokenomics logic implemented in Clarity
- **Migration Mechanics**: Automated epoch-based AVLP→AVG conversion  
- **Liquidity Mining**: Block-based rewards with loyalty bonuses
- **DAO Integration**: Full governance control over parameters

## **📊 ACTUAL SMART CONTRACT IMPLEMENTATION**

### **AVG Token (avg-token.clar)**

```clarity
Token: AutoVault Governance (AVG)
Max Supply: 10,000,000 AVG (10M for broader participation)
Decimals: 6 (micro-AVG precision)

Migration Epochs:
├── Epoch 1 (Blocks 1-1008): 1.0 AVG per AVLP baseline
├── Epoch 2 (Blocks 1009-2016): 1.2 AVG per AVLP (20% bonus)
└── Epoch 3 (Blocks 2017-3024): 1.5 AVG per AVLP (50% bonus)

Revenue Distribution:
├── 80% to AVG holders (REVENUE_SHARE_BPS: 8000)
└── 20% to protocol treasury (TREASURY_RESERVE_BPS: 2000)
```

### **AVLP Token (avlp-token.clar)**

```clarity
Token: AutoVault Liquidity Provider (AVLP)
Max Supply: 5,000,000 AVLP (5M for enhanced liquidity)
Decimals: 6 (micro-AVLP precision)
Purpose: Temporary token that migrates to AVG

Liquidity Mining:
├── Base Rewards: Per-block emissions based on epoch
├── Loyalty Bonuses: 5-25% extra for long-term LPs
├── Progressive Migration: Increasing AVG conversion rates
└── Emergency Migration: Auto-convert after Epoch 3
```

## **🚀 PRODUCTION TOKENOMICS FEATURES**

### **Phase 1: Enhanced Token Launch (IMPLEMENTED)**

- **AVG**: 10M supply for broad governance participation ✅
- **AVLP**: 5M supply for enhanced liquidity mining ✅
- **Progressive Migration**: Automated epoch-based conversion ✅
- **Revenue Sharing**: 80/20 split to holders/treasury ✅

### **Phase 2: Liquidity Mining (ACTIVE)**

```clarity
Liquidity Rewards (per epoch):
├── Epoch 1: Base rate 100 micro-AVLP per block
├── Epoch 2: Enhanced rate 150 micro-AVLP per block (+50%)  
└── Epoch 3: Maximum rate 200 micro-AVLP per block (+100%)

Loyalty Bonuses:
├── Short-term (100-500 blocks): +5% bonus
├── Medium-term (500-1000 blocks): +15% bonus
└── Long-term (1000+ blocks): +25% bonus
```

### **Phase 3: Migration Mechanics (AUTOMATED)**

```clarity
Migration Rates (implemented in avg-token.clar):
├── Epoch 1: 1,000,000 micro-AVG per AVLP (1:1 baseline)
├── Epoch 2: 1,200,000 micro-AVG per AVLP (1.2:1 bonus)
└── Epoch 3: 1,500,000 micro-AVG per AVLP (1.5:1 final)

Emergency Protection:
└── Auto-migration after block 3024 at final rate
```

### **Phase 4: Governance Revenue (PRODUCTION)**

```clarity
Revenue Distribution (implemented):
├── Collection: Vault fees → Treasury accumulation
├── Snapshot: Per-epoch revenue calculation  
├── Distribution: 80% to AVG holders proportionally
├── Claims: On-demand revenue claiming by holders
└── Reserve: 20% retained for protocol operations
```

## **📊 PRODUCTION ECONOMICS (10M Token Economy)**

### **Actual Implementation Economics**

```clarity
Revenue Distribution Model (implemented):
├── Monthly Protocol Revenue → Treasury Collection
├── Epoch Snapshots → Revenue per AVG calculation  
├── Proportional Distribution → 80% to AVG holders
├── On-Demand Claims → Users claim earned revenue
└── Treasury Reserve → 20% for protocol sustainability

Token Distribution (implemented in contracts):
AVG Supply: 10,000,000 tokens
├── DAO Community: 3,000,000 (30%) - Broad participation
├── Team/Founders: 2,000,000 (20%) - Vested over time
├── Treasury Ops: 2,000,000 (20%) - Protocol operations  
├── Migration Pool: 2,000,000 (20%) - ACTR/AVLP conversion
└── Reserve Fund: 1,000,000 (10%) - Emergency expansion

AVLP Supply: 5,000,000 tokens (migrates to AVG)
├── LP Rewards: 3,000,000 (60%) - Mining incentives
└── Migration Pool: 2,000,000 (40%) - Direct conversion
```

### **Economic Projections (Conservative Estimates)**

| Timeline | Monthly Revenue | AVG Holder Share | Revenue per Token |
|----------|-----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| **Month 1-3** | $50K-100K | $40K-80K | 1.3-2.7 cents |
| **Month 4-6** | $100K-250K | $80K-200K | 2.7-6.7 cents |
| **Month 7-12** | $250K-500K | $200K-400K | 6.7-13.3 cents |
| **Year 2** | $500K-1M | $400K-800K | 13.3-26.7 cents |
| **Mature State** | $1M+ | $800K+ | 26.7+ cents |

### **Broader Participation Benefits (10M vs 1M Supply)**

- **Lower Entry Barrier**: More tokens available at launch pricing
- **Reduced Whale Risk**: 10x dilution prevents large holder dominance
- **Better Liquidity**: Higher circulating supply for trading/governance
- **Scalable Growth**: Revenue per token attractive even with expansion

## **🛡️ PRODUCTION RISK MITIGATION**

```clarity
Smart Contract Protections:
├── Progressive Migration Bonuses → Retain LPs longer
├── Emergency Migration Function → Prevent value extraction  
├── Loyalty Reward System → Incentivize long-term participation
└── Revenue Sharing Model → Sustainable yield beyond farming
```

### 2. **Governance Security (IMPLEMENTED)**

```clarity
DAO Protection Mechanisms:
├── Timelock Controls → Major changes delayed for review
├── Multi-signature Requirements → Critical operations secured
├── Epoch-based Parameter Updates → Gradual system evolution
└── Emergency Pause Functions → Circuit breakers for safety
```

### 3. **Economic Sustainability (VERIFIED)**

```clarity
Long-term Viability:
├── Fee Optimization → Dynamic adjustment based on usage
├── Treasury Reserve → 20% protocol operational continuity
├── Revenue Diversification → Multiple protocol income streams
└── Token Supply Cap → Hard limit prevents inflation
```
