| 0x0C | Optional value handling patterns                   | âœ… Verified         | `(is-some ...)` and `(unwrap! ...)` are used to handle optional types.                                                                                                                            |
| 0x0D | Contract upgrade proxy implementation              | ðŸŸ¡ Partial          | No direct evidence of a proxy pattern was found in the listed contracts. This may be implemented at the deployment level.                                                                       |
| 0x0E | Gas optimization techniques                        | âœ… Verified         | Batching operations and efficient data structures are used to optimize gas, e.g., in `contracts/enhanced-batch-processing.clar`.                                                                |
| 0x0F | Test-driven development with clarinet              | âœ… Verified         | The `tests/` directory contains Clarity tests, and `stacks/sdk-tests/` contains TypeScript tests.                                                                                                 |
