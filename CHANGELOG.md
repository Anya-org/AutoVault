# CHANGELOG â€“ August 22, 2025

## Documentation Deduplication & Alignment

### Summary
- Deduplicated all major status and index documents to remove repeated contract/test status, summary, and validation blocks.
- Each document now focuses on its unique purpose and cross-links to canonical sources for contract/test status.
- Ensured all counts and dates are current and consistent across the repository.

### Changes
- `README.md`: Status and test counts clarified; remains canonical entry point.
- `documentation/STATUS.md`: Now focuses on operational, governance, and next steps. Cross-links to SYSTEM_STATUS_COMPREHENSIVE_REPORT.md for full status.
- `SYSTEM_STATUS_COMPREHENSIVE_REPORT.md`: Now focuses on performance, metrics, and recommendations. Cross-links to STATUS.md for operational details.
- `FULL_SYSTEM_INDEX.md`: Now focuses on vision, architecture, and roadmap. Cross-links to STATUS.md for current status.
- `FINAL_TESTNET_VERIFICATION.md`: Deduplicated; removed repeated contract/test status and summary blocks. Retains unique validation, checklist, and integration sections.
- `TESTNET_DEPLOYMENT_VERIFICATION.md`: Deduplicated; removed repeated contract/test status and summary blocks. Retains unique deployment, checklist, and upgrade plan content. Cross-links to STATUS.md for current status.

### Impact
- Documentation is now concise, non-redundant, and easier to maintain.
- All contract/test status is referenced from a single canonical source.
- Future updates require changes in only one place for status and counts.
