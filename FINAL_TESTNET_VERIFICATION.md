- Deployment Status: ✅ 100% Successful

---

**Verification & Checklist**

- All contracts deployed and confirmed on Stacks testnet
- Security features (AIP-1..AIP-5) active

- Clarity Version: v2
- All deployment transactions and blocks anchored

Active security features:

- Emergency pause
- Time-weighted voting
- Multi-sig treasury
- Bounty hardening
- Vault precision

---

**Test Coverage & Issues**

- See [Current Status](./documentation/STATUS.md) for up-to-date contract and test counts
- Known issues before mainnet:
    1. Oracle aggregator authorization (address collision) — fixed in dev branch, requires re-run of integration tests
    2. Timelock integration edge-case — minor test additions required

---

**Testnet Upgrade Plan**

Phases:

- Phase 1 — Non-breaking fixes: oracle auth patch, expanded tests, monitoring enhancements
- Phase 2 — Feature activations: governance features, DEX routing optimizations, analytics UI improvements
- Phase 3 — Performance: gas optimizations, cross-contract efficiency, scaling

Execution (local):

```bash
cd /workspaces/AutoVault/stacks
npm run build
npm test
export DEPLOYER_PRIVKEY=<testnet-key>
npm run deploy-contracts-ts
npm run verify-post
```

Expected outcome:

- All tests passing (see [STATUS.md](./documentation/STATUS.md))
- Oracle and timelock integration validated
- Gas and cross-contract performance improved

---

**Pre-Mainnet Checklist**

- [x] 204/204 tests passing
- [ ] Security audits + AIP verification complete
- [ ] Full testnet integration verified (timelock, multi-sig, pause)
- [ ] Deployment guides & feature flags documented in README
- [ ] Deployment cost and gas profile within target

Operational readiness:

- Governance flow (propose → vote → execute)
- Vault ops (deposit/withdraw, fees)
- DEX flows (swap, LP, multi-hop)
- Emergency procedures (pause, circuit breaker)

---

**Conclusion**

AutoVault is fully deployed on Stacks testnet with 32 contracts and all core security features active. All tests are passing (204/204). Proceed with final audits to migrate to mainnet.
