# 🔍 AutoVault Economic & Tokenomics Analysis – Main System Token Reassessment

**Date**: August 21, 2025  
**Scope**: Contract‑grounded reassessment of token architecture & need (or not) for a unified “main system token” (AAVE / ALEX style)  
**Sources of Truth Consulted**: `avg-token.clar`, `avlp-token.clar`, `creator-token.clar`, `gov-token.clar`, `vault-multi-token.clar` + PRD & Bitcoin ethos directives  
**Current Deployed Tokens (4)**: AVG, AVLP, ACTR, AGOV (legacy `gov-token`)  

---

## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The prior analysis contained marketing‑level assertions but omitted several contract realities (epoch migration mechanics, ACTR ↔ AVG conversion path, the practical role overlap between AVG & AGOV, and explicit revenue flow semantics). After line‑by‑line review of on‑chain contract code:

### Key Finding (Reaffirmed, Refined): **NO NEW MONOLITHIC “MAIN SYSTEM TOKEN” IS NEEDED**

However, two rationalization improvements are advised:

1. **Consolidate / Deprecate AGOV** (or formalize its distinct meta-governance domain) to avoid governance surface fragmentation.  
2. **Formalize ACTR Emission & Migration Policy** (cap, schedule, or bonding curve) to preserve sound‑money alignment and prevent uncontrolled upstream inflation migrating into AVG.

### Why No New Token?

- The **AVG token already embodies the consolidated value accrual layer** (revenue share: 80% via `REVENUE_SHARE_BPS u8000`) plus migration sink for productive contributions (ACTR) & liquidity mining (AVLP).  
- A new umbrella token would add dilution, distribution complexity, legal / regulatory surface, and user confusion while offering *no* incremental cryptoeconomic primitive not achievable by parameterizing existing contracts.  
- Bitcoin ethos (minimalism, determinism, capped monetary domains, resistance to rent seeking) favors *refinement* over proliferation.

## 🔎 CORRECTIONS TO PRIOR (OUTDATED) ANALYSIS

| Topic | Prior Text Issue | Contract Reality | Impact |
|-------|------------------|------------------|--------|
| Revenue Distribution | Claimed “direct 80% share” (correct) but lacked source | `avg-token.clar` constant `REVENUE_SHARE_BPS u8000` & `distribute-epoch-revenue` snapshot logic | Confirmed, should cite function & per‑epoch snapshot design |
| AVLP Migration Burn | Unclear if burn occurs | Burn executed inside `avlp-token.clar` `migrate-to-avg` (internal `burn-from`), the **commented burn** in `avg-token.clar` prevents double burn | Migration is deflation-neutral (no duplication) |
| ACTR Migration | Mentioned but not tied to code | `avg-token.clar::migrate-actr` calls `.creator-token burn` then mints AVG 1:1 | Correct; risk = unlimited ACTR mint policy upstream |
| AGOV Purpose | Labeled “Extended Governance” without source | `gov-token.clar` is a minimal SIP‑010 token with admin/DAO mint, no revenue, no time-weight weighting | Overlap / redundancy vs. AVG governance role |
| Token Count | Report said 4 specialized all equally production-critical | ACTR & AGOV are *auxiliary / peripheral* vs. AVG (core) & AVLP (transitional) | Refine role taxonomy |
| Supply Discipline | ACTR described as “variable merit issuance” (ok) w/o risk note | No cap or emission curve; unlimited mint via bounty/DAO; migration path can tunnel unconstrained value into AVG | Needs cap or emission governance guardrails |

## 🧬 CURRENT TOKEN ARCHITECTURE (DERIVED FROM CODE)

```text
AVG  (AutoVault Governance)
   Max Supply (hard cap): 10,000,000 (u10000000000000 @ 6 decimals)
   Roles: Governance, revenue share (80%), migration sink (ACTR, AVLP), epoch snapshots
   Core Functions: migrate-actr, migrate-avlp, distribute-epoch-revenue, claim-revenue, advance-epoch

AVLP (Liquidity Mining Transitional Token)
   Max Supply: 5,000,000 (u5000000000000 @ 6 decimals)
   Roles: Liquidity provision reward, migrates → AVG with epoch multipliers (1.0 / 1.2 / 1.5)
   Key Mechanics: provide-liquidity, claim-mining-rewards, migrate-to-avg, epoch reward config

ACTR (Creator / Bounty Reward Token)
   Supply: Uncapped (mint gated by bounty system or DAO)
   Roles: Compensation / contribution incentive; optional conversion path (burn → AVG 1:1)
   Risk: Unlimited upstream emissions could inflate AVG via migration if unchecked

AGOV (`gov-token.clar` – Legacy / Auxiliary Governance)
   Supply: Uncapped (admin/DAO controlled)
   Roles: Basic governance placeholder (no revenue, no weighting logic)
   Overlap: Functional duplication with AVG (primary); candidate for deprecation or repurpose (meta-governance / cross‑protocol coalition token)
```

### Role Taxonomy (Refined)

| Layer | Primary Token | Status | Strategic Notes |
|-------|---------------|--------|-----------------|
| Value Accrual / Core Governance | AVG | Core | Keep; enhance staking / lock mechanics (veAVG style) |
| Transitional Liquidity Incentive | AVLP | Sunset (time-bound) | Auto-sunset post epoch 3; finalize burn/migration analytics |
| Contribution Incentive | ACTR | Active (needs policy) | Add emission schedule + migration throttle |
| Legacy Auxiliary Governance | AGOV | Redundant / Optional | Consolidate or repurpose; avoid dual-governance confusion |

---

## 🧪 REVENUE & VALUE FLOW (ACTUAL MECHANICS)

1. Vault / protocol revenues aggregated off-contract then forwarded to `avg-token.clar::distribute-epoch-revenue(total-revenue)` (authorization restricted to `vault`).  
2. Snapshot stores: `total-revenue`, `avg-supply`, `revenue-per-token` (micro‑unit scaling).  
3. Holders claim via `claim-revenue(epoch)`; claim prevention enforced with per‑epoch map `revenue-claims`.  
4. AVLP & ACTR migration = *entry funnel* into capped AVG domain (deflation alignment) provided ACTR emission remains bounded.  

### Identified Economic Risks

| Risk | Description | Severity | Mitigation Recommendation |
|------|-------------|----------|---------------------------|
| ACTR Infinite Emission | Unlimited ACTR → burned → AVG (value dilution risk) | High | Introduce ACTR yearly cap & DAO rate schedule; add migration epoch limit |
| Governance Fragmentation | AVG + AGOV voting ambiguity | Medium | Sunset AGOV or silo into meta-governance; publish governance scope matrix |
| Liquidity Mining Overhang | AVLP tokens un‑migrated at epoch end | Medium | Forced `emergency-migrate-all` audit + reporting; publish migration progress dashboard |
| Revenue Timing Manipulation | Large revenue injected just before snapshot claim | Low | Move to *block range* pro‑rata accrual or rolling TWAP of balance snapshots |
| Migration Rate Assumptions | Epoch multipliers hard-coded; incentive gaming | Low | DAO-adjustable dynamic based on realized liquidity KPIs |

---

## 🔄 OPTION MATRIX: MAIN TOKEN INTRO VS. STATUS QUO

| Option | Description | Pros | Cons | Recommendation |
|--------|-------------|------|------|----------------|
| A | Introduce new unified “AUTO” token | Marketing splash; fresh distribution narrative | Dilution, added complexity, regulatory overhead, dev/test cost | ❌ Reject |
| B | Elevate AVG as sole canonical governance + value token (deprecate AGOV) | Simplifies mental model; reduces attack surface | Requires migration of any AGOV balances / votes | ✅ Adopt |
| C | Keep both AVG & AGOV (dual chamber) | Experimental bicameral governance | Complexity; voter confusion; low current AGOV differentiation | ⚠️ Only if DAO mandates |
| D | Add vote‑escrow (veAVG) layer instead of new token | Aligns long-term holders; boosts security | Contract extension complexity | ✅ Phase 2 enhancement |

**Outcome**: Path **B** + future **D** (ve-style locking) dominates alternative of new token creation.

## 🆚 COMPETITIVE GAP (UPDATED)

| Feature Dimension | AutoVault (Post-Rationalization) | ALEX | AAVE | UNI | Curve (ve) | Advantage |
|------------------|----------------------------------|------|------|-----|------------|-----------|
| Core Accrual Token | AVG (capped, revenue share) | ALEX (single) | AAVE (single) | UNI (governance only) | CRV/veCRV | ✅ Diversified inflow (migrations + revenue) |
| Liquidity Incentives | Transitional AVLP w/ epoch multipliers | Mining (direct) | Liquidity mining (historical) | LP only | Gauges | ↔ (Comparable) |
| Contribution Incentives | ACTR (burn-to-AVG) | Grants | Grants | Grants | Grants | ✅ Integrated migration path |
| Governance Sophistication | Time-weight + potential ve upgrade | Standard | Safety Module + gov | Simple | ve-locking advanced | 🟡 Add ve layer to close gap |
| Revenue Distribution | Direct per-epoch snapshot claim | Fee-based buybacks | Safety module yield | None (fee switch off) | Boosted gauges | ✅ Direct, transparent |
| Bitcoin Ethos Alignment | Multi-asset specialization, caps | Single token | Single token | Single token | Multi-layer (not BTC native) | ✅ Ethos-aligned |

---

## 🛠 RECOMMENDED ENHANCEMENT ROADMAP

### Phase 0 (Immediate – Pre Audit Freeze)

1. Publish *Token Role Matrix* (AVG vs ACTR vs AVLP vs AGOV).  
2. DAO vote to **deprecate or re-scope AGOV**.  
3. Draft ACTR emission policy (annual cap + linear / milestone unlock).  

### Phase 1 (Post Security Audit)

1. Implement optional **veAVG (vote‑escrow)** contract (time-locked boosts for voting + revenue multiplier).  
2. Introduce **revenue smoothing** (rolling accrual) to reduce snapshot timing games.  
3. Add **migration analytics endpoints** (expose migrated-avlp / migrated-actr progress).  

### Phase 2

1. Add **dynamic AVLP → AVG multiplier** oracle (KPIs: liquidity depth, volatility).  
2. Introduce **deflation valve** (protocol buyback & burn: triggered if treasury > threshold).  
3. Explore **cross‑protocol meta-governance** (if AGOV repurposed, else drop).  

### Phase 3

1. Evaluate **staking derivatives (sAVG)** once veAVG stable.  
2. Consider **inter-protocol alliance incentives** via curated supported token weights (ties to `vault-multi-token`).

## 🔐 SOUND MONEY & BITCOIN ETHOS SCORECARD

| Criterion | Current Score | Notes | Improvement Action |
|----------|---------------|-------|--------------------|
| Fixed Supply (Core) | High | AVG (10M), AVLP (5M) hard caps | Maintain immutable constants |
| Peripheral Inflation Control | Medium | ACTR & AGOV uncapped | Add caps or emission governance |
| Decentralized Power | High | Multi-role tokens reduce capture | Consolidate governance in AVG + ve layer |
| Transparency | Medium-High | Revenue snapshot events present | Add on-chain cumulative index & explorer docs |
| Risk Mitigation | Medium | Migration + uncapped feeders | Add throttles & emission caps |

---

## 🚫 WHY NOT INTRODUCE A NEW “MAIN” TOKEN NOW

| Dimension | New Token Adds | But Costs / Risks |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| Narrative | Short-term marketing splash | Long-term dilution & complexity |
| Utility | Overlaps existing AVG functions | Redundant logic & audit scope expansion |
| Security | No intrinsic improvement | Larger attack & governance surface |
| Ethos | Potential bloat | Violates minimalism & capped domains |

Conclusion: **Refine; don’t proliferate.**

---

## 📌 DECISION SUMMARY

| Decision Point | Recommendation | Rationale |
|----------------|---------------|-----------|
| Introduce unified main token? | NO | AVG already central accrual & governance hub |
| Deprecate AGOV? | YES (unless repurposed) | Removes duplicate governance vector |
| Cap ACTR emissions? | YES | Prevent indirect AVG dilution via migration |
| Maintain AVLP migration schedule? | YES (audit metrics) | Clean transition narrative |
| Add veAVG? | YES (Phase 1) | Increases long-term alignment & security |
| Add deflation mechanic? | CONDITIONAL | Deploy only after usage metrics justify |

---

## ✅ FINAL RECOMMENDATION

Remain with **no additional main system token**. Instead: (1) consolidate governance onto **AVG (+ future veAVG)**, (2) cap & policy‑govern ACTR emissions, (3) gracefully sunset AVLP post-epoch 3 with transparent migration reporting, (4) remove or repurpose AGOV to avoid governance ambiguity. This path maximizes Bitcoin ethos alignment (scarcity + specialization), preserves user clarity, and minimizes new audit surface while deepening economic resilience.

## 🧾 FORMAL POLICY: ACTR EMISSION & MIGRATION

### Objectives

1. Preserve AVG scarcity & predictability.  
2. Incentivize high-quality contribution (bounties / audits / R&D).  
3. Prevent uncontrolled upstream inflation tunneling into AVG via migration.  
4. Maintain DAO oversight with transparent scheduling & on‑chain verifiability.

### Emission Classes

| Class | Purpose | Annual Allocation (Year 1 Cap) | Vesting | Approval Path |
|-------|---------|--------------------------------|---------|---------------|
| Bounties / Audits | Security + feature delivery | 40% | 3m cliff + 9m linear | Pre-approved budget (DAO) |
| Core Dev Grants | Sustained protocol dev | 30% | 6m linear | DAO + timelock |
| Ecosystem / Integrations | Partner incentives | 15% | 2m cliff + 10m linear | DAO |
| Emergency / Critical Response | Zero‑day fixes, urgent ops | 10% | Immediate (optional 1m lock) | Multi-sig + retro DAO ratify |
| Reserve / Unallocated | Future strategic | 5% | N/A (frozen) | DAO supermajority |

Initial Year ACTR Emission Ceiling (Y1): 5% of fully diluted AVG supply equivalent (i.e., ACTR minted <= 5,000,000 units if AVG cap = 100,000,000). Adjust downward 10% per subsequent year (decay factor) unless DAO overrides with 2/3 supermajority.

### Migration Throttle (ACTR → AVG)

| Parameter | Spec | Rationale |
|-----------|------|-----------|
| Per Epoch Max Conversion | 2% of circulating AVG supply | Avoid sudden dilution shocks |
| Per Address Daily Cap | 0.25% of circulating AVG | Mitigate accumulation flush attacks |
| Cooldown After Large Claim | 144 blocks (~1 day) if >0.10% converted | Smooth distribution |
| Global Emergency Kill-Switch | DAO timelock (24h) + circuit breaker flag | Response to exploit |

Unconverted ACTR remains valid indefinitely; DAO may introduce future bonus windows (e.g., +5% conversion uplift) for strategic accelerations—cumulative bonuses capped at 10% lifetime.

### Vesting & Compliance

All non-public (grant/strategic) ACTR allocations minted via `mint-with-vesting`; linear vesting minimum 6 months unless class explicitly shorter (audits). Migration requires vested balance. Attempted migration of locked ACTR reverts with standard error (assign code u131 if unused).

### Reporting & Transparency

| Metric | Frequency | Source |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| ACTR Minted (by class) | Weekly | Emission registry map |
| Cumulative Migration % | Per epoch | Snapshot in AVG contract extension (future) |
| Throttle Utilization | Per epoch | Derived from migration events |
| Outstanding Vested (Locked) | Weekly | Vesting schedule aggregation |

DAO dashboard must display: (a) Remaining annual emission headroom, (b) Migration throttle headroom current epoch, (c) Time until throttle resets.

## 🧩 AGOV CONSOLIDATION & SUPPLY STRATEGY

### Problem

AGOV duplicates governance utility supplied by AVG without distinct economic rights (no revenue share, no weighting). Maintaining both increases surface area and dilutes voter attention.

### Consolidation Paths

| Path | Description | Pros | Cons | Recommendation |
|------|-------------|------|------|----------------|
| Sunset + One-Way Migration | Freeze AGOV mint; allow AGOV→AVG at fixed ratio; burn AGOV | Simplifies governance; predictable | Temporary migration ops overhead | ✅ Primary |
| Repurpose as Meta Layer | AGOV governs cross‑protocol alliances only | Segregates domains | Needs new value rationale | ⚠️ Optional |
| Wrapper / ve Layer | AGOV becomes escrow receipt for locked AVG | Reuses contract | Complexity; mismatch with minimal token code | ❌ Reject |

### Proposed Sunset Mechanics

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Snapshot Block (Start) | T + 7 days from DAO approval |
| Migration Window | 180 days |
| Migration Ratio | 1 AGOV : X AVG (determine after AGOV total supply snapshot; target <0.5% new AVG issuance) |
| Unmigrated AGOV After Window | Burned / invalidated |
| Mint Freeze Activation | Immediate on proposal execution |

NEW AVG hard cap (100M) must not be exceeded, minted AVG for AGOV migration draws from pre-reserved “governance consolidation allowance” (subset of existing unminted supply). If insufficient, ratio auto-scales down to maintain cap. Publish formula: ratio = min( target_pool / agov_total , max_ratio ).

### Supply Accessibility & Price Perception

Goal: Avoid prohibitive unit pricing at very high market capitalization while preserving scarcity.

| Strategy | Implements | Supply Impact | Scarcity Effect | Risk |
|----------|-----------|--------------|-----------------|------|
| Maintain 10M Cap (Status Quo) | No change | None | Strong | High nominal price at extreme valuations |
| Pre-Mainnet Cap Adjustment (e.g., 100M) | Redeploy before final mainnet | +10x headroom | Moderate | Requires full re-audit |
| Wrapper Denomination (mAVG = 1e-3 AVG) | Off-chain UI / indexer | None | Intact | Minimal |
| Split via New Token / Migration | Issue new higher-supply token | Resets supply | Potential dilution confusion | High |

Because existing divisibility (6 decimals) already enables fine-grained ownership, **recommend retaining 10M cap** and solving affordability in UX via denomination display (e.g., milli‑AVG, micro‑AVG) rather than expanding hard supply. Cap change only considered if: (a) pre-mainnet freeze not yet locked, (b) DAO supermajority, (c) independent audit of all references to MAX_SUPPLY.

### Consolidation Execution Checklist

1. Draft DAO Proposal: Include migration ratio formula, throttle & burn schedule.  
2. Implement Read-Only View: `get-agov-migration-stats` (supply, migrated, remaining).  
3. Add Migration Function: Accept AGOV, mint AVG (bounded by pool).  
4. Emit Events: `agov-migrated {sender, amount-agov, amount-avg}`.  
5. Post-Migration Finalization: Disable function; emit `agov-sunset`.  
6. Update Documentation & API reference.  
7. Regression Tests: Governance, revenue, circuit breaker unaffected.  
8. Security Review: Ensure no re-entrancy / overflow in migration path.

## 🎯 **MAIN SYSTEM TOKEN ASSESSMENT**

### **Question: Should AutoVault Create a Main System Token?**

#### **Answer: NO - Current Architecture is Superior**

**Reasons Against Main System Token:**

1. **Economic Sophistication**
   - Current 4-token model provides **more utility** than single tokens
   - Specialized functions optimize for different user types
   - Revenue distribution more **direct and efficient**

2. **Bitcoin Ethos Alignment**
   - Multiple tokens = **decentralized power structure**
   - Prevents single-token governance domination
   - Aligns with Bitcoin's **distributed system philosophy**

3. **Competitive Advantage**
   - AutoVault's multi-token model is **more advanced** than ALEX/AAVE
   - Provides better **participant specialization**
   - Creates **multiple value accrual mechanisms**

4. **Technical Implementation**
   - Current system is **production-ready** and tested
   - Migration costs would be **significant**
   - No clear technical benefit to consolidation

### **Alternative: Token ID Simplification**

Instead of a main system token, consider **token symbol optimization**:

#### **Current Token Symbols**

```text
CURRENT NAMING:
├── AVG (AutoVault Governance) ✅ Good
├── AVLP (AutoVault Liquidity Provider) ✅ Good  
├── ACTR (AutoCreator) 🟡 Could improve
└── GOV (Generic) 🟡 Could improve
```

#### **Recommended Symbol Enhancement**

```text
OPTIMIZED NAMING:
├── AVG (AutoVault Governance) ✅ Keep
├── AVLP (AutoVault Liquidity Provider) ✅ Keep
├── ACTR → AVBR (AutoVault Bounty Rewards) 🎯 Better clarity
└── GOV → AVEX (AutoVault Extended Governance) 🎯 Better branding
