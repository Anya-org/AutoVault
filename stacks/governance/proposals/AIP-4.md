# AIP-4: Bounty System Security Hardening

## Simple Summary
Implement comprehensive security measures for the bounty system to prevent reward manipulation and double spending.

## Abstract
This proposal enhances bounty system security by adding robust validation mechanisms, preventing double spending, and implementing proper completion verification.

## Motivation
The bounty system may be vulnerable to double spending attacks and fraudulent completion claims, potentially draining protocol funds.

## Specification
- Add cryptographic proof requirements for bounty completion
- Implement milestone-based payments with validation
- Add dispute resolution mechanism for bounty conflicts
- Require independent verification for high-value bounties

## Rationale
Robust bounty validation ensures protocol funds are only distributed for legitimate work while maintaining the incentive structure for contributors.

## Test Cases
- Double spending attempts are prevented
- Completion validation works correctly
- Dispute resolution mechanism functions properly
