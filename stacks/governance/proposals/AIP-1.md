# AIP-1: Enable Emergency Pause for Vault

## Simple Summary
Enable emergency pause for the vault contract to protect user funds in case of exploit or vulnerability.

## Abstract
This proposal introduces a multi-sig controlled emergency pause and unpause mechanism to the vault.clar contract, allowing authorized parties to halt vault operations during emergencies.

## Motivation
Protect user funds and platform integrity by enabling rapid response to detected threats or exploits.

## Specification
- Implement `pause` and `unpause` functions in vault.clar
- Restrict access to these functions to a multi-sig admin group
- When paused, all vault operations (deposits, withdrawals, etc.) are disabled

## Rationale
A multi-sig controlled pause mechanism reduces the risk of a single point of failure and ensures that emergency actions require consensus among trusted parties.

## Test Cases
- Only multi-sig can pause/unpause
- Vault operations are disabled when paused
- Vault operations resume when unpaused
